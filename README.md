Reci-Pic is an innovative recipe recommendation application developed during my internship at AI Camp. This project aims to streamline the cooking experience by leveraging computer vision and machine learning to help users make delicious meals using the ingredients they have on hand.

## Features

- **Ingredient Recognition**: Reci-Pic employs the YOLOV5 computer vision model to accurately detect and extract ingredients from pictures of users' refrigerators.

- **Recipe Recommendations**: The application provides users with a curated list of recipes based on the ingredients detected in their fridge photos. This helps reduce food waste and encourages creativity in the kitchen.

- **User-Friendly Interface**: The Flask-based web app offers an intuitive and user-friendly interface. Users can easily upload their fridge pictures, view recommended recipes, and interact with the platform effortlessly.
